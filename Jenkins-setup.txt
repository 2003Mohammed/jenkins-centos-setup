# Jenkins Installation & Setup on CentOS / RHEL (Port 8090)

 File paths and service locations can vary slightly by distro/version. Commands shown are based on common RHEL/CentOS patterns.

## Overview

Jenkins is a popular open‑source automation server used for CI/CD. You can install Jenkins on **Debian/Ubuntu** using `apt`, or on **RHEL/CentOS/Alma/Rocky/Oracle Linux** using **`yum` + `rpm`**.

In this guide, Jenkins is installed on a **CentOS / RHEL‑based system** and configured to run on **port 8090 instead of the default 8080**.

---

## Prerequisites

* CentOS / RHEL / AlmaLinux / Rocky Linux
* Sudo privileges
* Internet access

---

## Step 1: Add Jenkins Repository

```bash
sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo \
https://pkg.jenkins.io/rpm-stable/jenkins.repo
```

Upgrade existing packages:

```bash
sudo yum upgrade -y
```

---

## Step 2: Install Java (Required)

Jenkins requires Java. Here we use **Java 21**:

```bash
sudo yum install -y fontconfig java-21-openjdk
```

Verify:

```bash
java -version
```

---

## Step 3: Install Jenkins

```bash
sudo yum install -y jenkins
```

Reload systemd:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

---

## Step 4: Change Jenkins Port (8080 → 8090)

By default, Jenkins runs on **port 8080**. We change it to **8090**.

### Option A (Common): Edit Jenkins Environment File using insert mode by clicking lowercase i

```bash
sudo vi /etc/sysconfig/jenkins
```

Find:

```bash
JENKINS_PORT="8080"
```

Change to:

```bash
JENKINS_PORT="8090"
```

Save and exit using esc and :wq .

### Option B (If environment is defined in service file)

```bash
sudo vi /usr/lib/systemd/system/jenkins.service
```

Look for:

```bash
Environment="JENKINS_PORT=8080"
```

Change to:

```bash
Environment="JENKINS_PORT=8090"
```

Reload systemd again:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

---

## Step 5: Start & Enable Jenkins

Enable Jenkins at boot:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable jenkins
```

Start Jenkins:

```bash
sudo systemctl start jenkins
```

Check status:

```bash
sudo systemctl status jenkins
```

---

## Step 6: Access Jenkins UI

Open browser:

```
http://localhost:8090
```

---

## Step 7: Unlock Jenkins

Get initial admin password:

```bash
sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
```

Paste it into **Unlock Jenkins** screen → **Continue**.

---

## Step 8: Install Plugins

Choose one:

* **Install suggested plugins** (recommended)
* **Select plugins to install** (manual)

Wait for installation to complete.

---

## Step 9: Create Admin User

Fill:

* Username
* Password
* Full name
* Email

Click **Save and Finish** → **Start using Jenkins**.

---

## Step 10: I Created a Sample Freestyle Job called sample build

### Job Configuration

* **Type**: Freestyle project
* **Source Code Management**: Git
* **Repository URL**:

```
https://github.com/2003Mohammed/Jenkins-installation.git
```

* **Branch**:

```
main
```

### Build Trigger

Enable **Poll SCM**:

```text
H/1 * * * *
```

---

## Step 11: Build Step (Execute Shell)

```bash
echo "===== JENKINS FREESTYLE BUILD START ====="

echo "Workspace location:"
pwd

echo "Listing files:"
ls -la

echo "Git branch:"
git branch

echo "Build step placeholder completed"

echo "===== BUILD END ====="
```

---

## Step 12: Build & Verify

* Click **Build Now**
* Check **Console Output**
* Verify repository checkout and shell execution

* Unlock Jenkins screen
* Plugin installation
* Freestyle job configuration
* Successful build output

---

## Summary

* Jenkins installed using **YUM + RPM** on RHEL‑based OS
* Default port changed from **8080 → 8090**
* Jenkins secured with admin user
* GitHub repo integrated
* Freestyle job built successfully

This setup demonstrates a **basic but production‑style Jenkins installation** suitable for CI/CD learning and DevOps workflows.
